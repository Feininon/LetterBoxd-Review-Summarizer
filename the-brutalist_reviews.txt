I’ve been waiting to review this one for about a week. This movie feels like the great novels of the 19th century. You get to live a life with someone and then it ends
  
  ★★★★     Watched by Facundo Diaz  24 Mar 2025   
Merece verla de nuevo, hay muchos detalles y cositas que te perdes en el primer visionado y que seguro cobran sentido en el segundo. Probablemente sume puntos con eso. Te da aparte esa sensación de que cada plano tiene un peso visual gigantesco y que viendola de nuevo podes sacar nuevos significados. Igual medio al pedo que sean casi 4 hs tambien qcy.Tambien hay un par de escenas que me dejaron shockeado mal.
Muy buena.

Opinion remains pretty much the same, but I was mostly just shocked at how much of this still worked without a huge screen this time around. Can't wait to see what time does to it and what Corbet decides to follow it up with.

Firme y sólida en sus aspectos técnicos.Pero su narrativa comienza a perder el hilo al final.No hay un punto donde se sostenga y finaliza más rápido que tarde.El último salto de tiempo, acorta todo demasiado pronto y perdemos esta rica experiencia del personaje y el propio estigma que se tenía.

I should've added this to my movies that should never leave theaters list. The fact this movie didn't even cost 10 million to make is proof how out of control Hollywood budgets have gotten. Even going to the point of using VistaVision to recapture the time period when we haven't gotten a movie fully shot with it in over 60 years. The "they don't make them like they used to" crowd should watch this.

Pasé mucho tiempo pensando qué escribir. O cómo escribirlo. Pasé mucho tiempo pensando en esta película, y por muy poderosa que me haya parecido en su primer tramo, lamento mucho no poder conectarte o sentirme a gusto con su tramo final, y su resolución. 
Creo que una película sobre un inmigrante obsesionado por una obra que se ergia más allá de él como individuo y lo obsesionaba profundamente, mientras batallaba contra sus demonios, ya era de por sí una premisa…
  
  ★★★     Watched by hof1234  24 Mar 2025   
I could go on for like 3 hours about this one. If I could wipe clean my brain it might be an amazing movie. First half went crazy and the acting was sick but I think it wanted its seminal moments too much. In a perfect world it’s like “there will be blood” good but it felt like they wanted Oppenheimer except with a fake architect and a kinda inaccurate spin on the architects who inspired it. Could not be…

Visually impressive with a score that is ACTUALLY deserving of its accolades, this one fails thematically as it ignores an obvious through line to modern struggles of immigration, nationalism, and the universal consequences of genocide.  
There are plenty of strong moments in its 3.5 hour run time. And for all the chatter, The Brutalist’s use of AI is the least offensive aspect of the film. (I’d personally go so far as to say the editing team’s use of AI…

Ambicioso como uma grande construção arquitetônica, o filme combina uma estética visual marcante — a brutalidade do concreto e a beleza do mármore — com uma tentativa de emplacar uma narrativa introspectiva sobre arte, identidade e força. Consegue em alguns momentos, mas se perde em muitos outros. Adrien Brody entrega uma excelente interpretação, mas uma obra de arte não vive apenas de uma boa atuação. Por fim, é excessivamente longo.

Okay, good movie...::: Really good acting, creating a very European character that strongly marks the difference with the other American characters.::: Very peculiar directing style, with a search for a different but minimalist elegant style, and therefore, it doesn't alienate you but invites you.....Okay... BUT....Another film, along with a thousand others, that marks the misfortunes of that ethnicity-religion, ONCE AGAIN ??... and what about the other ethnicities-religions that are going through misfortunes today??...Come on, enough is enough...This element alone, sadly, counterbalances all its merits
  
  ★★★½      Watched by laurenhertz77  24 Mar 2025   
Dare I say I strongly disliked the end of the second act and the ending? Idk I just felt like the ending was 0 substance and just there to say look what he did with no satisfaction at all to his storyline. I honestly would’ve liked it ending on the search for Harrison and the building being completed after all that time as a ode to him, but nonetheless it was stunning and I agree, it needed the long run time to tell the whole thing.

tellement de beaux plans et un scénario parfaitement ancré dans l'histoire, des acteurs fousss malades, une exploration de l'antisémitisme pendant les années 1940-1980 (qui, en dehors de "vrais" documentaires, est une représentation peu fréquente dans les médias)
.léger spoil storytelling?et aussi très intéressant les lettres qui rythment chacune des parties du films.
  
  ★★★      Watched by Gaby Ocampo  24 Mar 2025   
THE BRUTALIST isAn ambitious albeit lifeless story of tormented genius, something we've seen before told with minimum budget, huge length and high levels of pretentiousness. As an effort of independent filmmaking it's a marvelous achievement, with beautiful camera work, stunningly detailed set pieces and great performances. But when you pay to watch a 3 and a half hour movie you're expecting more somehow. Maybe the narrative is lackluster or the characters are too stiff and reactionary. Maybe the music…

É engraçado o quanto escessivamente aberto e grande o roteiro é. O que pode gerar momentos e indagações legais do tipo: oq caralho o isso significa?? Oq ele realmente queria dizer com isso??Mas no geral a sensação de um espaço que não foi bem preenchida foi dominante. As atuação tirando do Brody são ruins, especialmente a zsofia ela é uma personagem quase que vazia, esquecida no meio do roteiro, assim como diversos outros que não são bem aproveitados no filme.No geral o que segura msm é o personagem do Brody e a curiosidade pra vê uma grande edifício de concreto.

Talvez a nota esteja alta até por eu gostar muito de arquitetura brutalista (uma das coisas que mais gostei no filme foram os cenários ambientados na construção)
É inegável que as atuações aqui são impecáveis, principalmente do Adrien Brody, mas sla... Não saí impactado de qualquer forma, acabou sendo algo meio tanto faz.
Mas devo dizer que o filme passa bem rápido, apesar de passar de 3 horas de duração. A trilha sonora e a direção de qualidade ajudam a…

Film très sympathique ! Histoire de l’arrivée d’un architecte aux States juif issu d’Hongrie après la GM2 et pendant la guerre froide pour essayer de se reconstruire et vivre le rêve américain 
Le jeu d’acteur de Brody est exemplaire, son expression facile réussi parfaitement à s’adapter à ses émotions 
La scène en Italie, à la recherche du marbre plan, qui termine sur la soirée dans une grotte/tunnel avec le vword est excellent 
+1 pour l’entracte au regard des 3h30 des…

I liked the performances, particularly that of Adrien Brody, more than the movie itself. That said, I had nothing against it and found it to be pretty decent and respectable enough. Also, I found much of Guy Pearce's to be phoney. I don't know if it was JUST the way he delivered his lines or what, but his acting just seemed less authentic than the other actors and actresses on screen. I'm not saying he's a bad actor in the least, but for his performance in this one I just didn't feel it.

This was such a beautiful film, the epilogue section really flew over my head in a lot of ways so maybe when I’m not so exhausted from sleep deprivation I can look more into this and it’ll get a higher rating (maybe) 
yeah I see why this won Oscars!

This film is a masterpiece imo 5/5. Adrien Brody absolutely gorgeous to look at, especially in his broad shouldered suit jackets and slacks. And that blue jumper in the scene in the New York flat?!!?!? Breathtaking scenes in Carrara too. Stunning, epic, totally immersive, deliciously stylish, loved it

À l'usure, mais ça m'a eu...
Un peu brouillon dans la quantite de choses qu'il veut aborder, tout en ne prenant pas toujours le temps de le faire réellement. Et pourtant c'est long, certes bien rythmé, mais long, trop long. C'est l'exposition interminable à ces personnages qui te fait t'y attacher, car ils sont finalement peu verbeux ou dans le cliché quand ils s'expriment enfin...
Tout est beau, prêt à accoucher d'une grand œuvre. Ça ne sera pas la plus marquante mais elle mérite d'être vue.

This film was exactly what we all thought Megalopolis would be, but it wasn’t.
Breathtaking. Impressive. Grandiose. Brutal.
Everything fit perfectly. The cinematography completely captivated me, and the way brutalist architecture, with its focus on minimalism, yet its rawness and authenticity, was made for the big screen. It was a spectacular spectacle with fantastic performances from all the actors.
(We'll ignore the AI and the questionable Hungarian accent.)

Le film gagne une étoile avec Brody mais sinon c’est lamentable franchement. Déjà, ils tournent le film autours de 4 parties avec une entracte au milieu comme au théâtre. À partir de là, quand on a la prétention de faire une œuvre d’art, faut assumer derrière. De manière générale, le film n’a aucune profondeur. Les dialogues sont trop longs, y’a pas de fond et globalement le film retransmet aucune émotion (à part bcp de dégoût c’était horrible).La première partie…

excelentemente y necesariamente larga. debo admitir que hubo sólo cinco minutos que me pareció innecesaria su longitud. en líneas generales, me gusto mucho mucho. y a mi que no me interesa en lo más mínimo la arquitectura me pareció entretenida e incluso llevadera. me gusta que se tome el tiempo necesario para mostrarte hasta el mas mínimo detalle y banco el humo del intermedio. PERO, bajo un poco cuando me enteré que no es una historia verdadera. yo siempre pensé…

Im Gartenbaukino gab es heute die 70mm Version von „The Brutalist“. Das Gartenbaukino ist das einzige Kino in Wien, dass dieses Format abspielen kann. Eine zweite Besonderheit gibt es auch noch, denn der Film hat eine Pause. Bei einer Laufzeit von mehr als dreieinhalb Stunden durchaus sinnvoll. Der Film skizziert das fiktive Leben des Bauhaus-Architekten und Holocaust-Überlebenden László Tóth, der 1947 in die USA auswandert, um den „amerikanischen Traum“ zu verwirklichen. Er bekommt den Auftrag ein Kulturzentrum zu bauen und…

This movie is an anomaly, I have no idea how they got the budget for this. I ain't but complaining though because I thoroughly enjoyed it.
The cinematography is magnificent while not being presumptuous. The sets are massive and coherent through the whole movie. Im especially fond of the cave / reservoir that reminded me of "Shiki-jitsu".
As for the content, it will take time to digest – It's very dense. I always wondered how an artist and its patron interacts but I quickly realized, it will not be very representative here.
I wish they made real biopic like this, we usually get unmotivated movies.

I'll admit that I was nervous about the running time but I was never bored, even at 3 and half hours (with an interval). The first half is definitely better than the second half. In fact, there's scene in the second half that threatens to over shadow the whole film and the ending is so clumsy I'm struggling to figure out what the intention was. But the acting is good and the scale of it is so impressive considering how cheaply it was all done.

Vida y obra de László Tóth, un arquitecto genial y atormentado por el recuerdo del Holocausto. "El brutalista" no cuenta la historia real de un sobreviviente del Holocausto, pero el protagonista es una manifestación de todos, ficticios o no. Tampoco habla de un arquitecto brutalista que existió en la realidad, pero encarna el espíritu de los creadores y artistas de este movimiento.Lászlo Tóth es, pues, un personaje ficticio que se siente real debido a la verosimilitud tanto de su…

Peut être pas un commentaire très original pour un film qui parle d’architecture mais c’était : monumental. Difficile de savoir par où commencer mais déjà les plans sont tous incroyables, réalisés avec une minutie hors du commun, chaque image reste gravée sur la rétine. Ça permet dans un premier temps de planter un décor très détaillé où chaque élément résonne à la perfection avec les autres, comme dans un grand orchestre. Pourtant, dès les débuts du film on sent qu’il…

The brutalist bought together different themes and stories that are well documented and often spoken about/ represented in art, but packaged them altogether in such a unique way. Having these themes set against the backdrop of an architect’s story also made it feel very original and shocking/ sad 
The music was incredible!

Cuando la historia no cuenta absolutamente nada pero la película aun así te mantiene enganchado durante 3 horas y media dice mucho de cómo está ejecutado este metraje. Literalmente el argumento se puede resumir en: Un tío que construye un edificio.

Like the runtime of the movie, it took longer then usual to formulate my thoughts on this movie.Despite the length I rarely felt bored throughout and besides some points in the latter half the pacing was excellent. So many things worked, from the bombastic music, to the phenomenal acting. A solemn story of passion/duty, of the point of doing something or results that come from it. My biggest gripe for me is the ending, with such a character focused…
