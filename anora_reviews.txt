  ★★     Watched by ianmarkendorf  23 Mar 2025   
The story has much potential. I like how they showed the whole story, particularly the sex workers' environment, in a much more darker and explicit way than these kind of movies tend to do soHowever, it was difficult to emphasize with the characters, as they didn't seem to maturely or rationally at all

i don't know what's worse — a gross puke scene or being on edge waiting for another gross puke scene the rest of the movie. 
other than that tho it's great

I wish I could've liked this one more. There's undeniable merit from a filmmaking standpoint, especially in its cinematography and acting. I just couldn't get on board with the film's pacing and didn't have much investment at all in any of the characters, which made it difficult for me to enjoy.

i enjoyed it for it was! it was a fun movie and an interesting story from a marginalized perspective and i will always respect that for what it is. other than that it wasn’t anything too special, i spent a lot of it thinking what tf is going on? but that kept it fun. i think the ending was as realistic and good as any. solid film.
  
  ★★★★½     Watched by Ashley  24 Mar 2025   
SO GOOD!! I wasn’t expecting to love the movie this much but I do. The last scene was the cherry on top. So many emotions. So many details. I loved Anora’s accent. I felt so bad for character, she just wanted to be loved. I also just love Igor.

I watched half of this before the Oscar’s and the other half after. I really enjoyed where the movie went and I think it’s cool that it won, but I’m surprised more movies of quality were not released this year. Hopefully next will be better

This one was fun as soon as it the halfway mark. Not sure if it was Oscar worthy in my opinion, but Mikey Madison and Yuriy Borisov were great! Enjoyed seeing Aleksey Serebryakov on screen since seeing in “Nobody.” Yup, liked it more than I thought I would

Anora is so strange. This might be the most confused I've ever been when trying to rate a movie on this app. I genuinely have no idea what to think of this movie. I watched this because I saw a lot of positive reviews and I liked Mikey Madsion in Scream 5, but it was not as good as I was expecting. This movie goes on forever and doesn't accomplish much in that runtime. It has some interesting ideas sprinkled…

This is actually one of my favorite movies of all time. I laughed out loud so much. I actually love her character so much, best actress was so well deserved. I love Igor too ugh and the armenian men, they were all so funny. The scene where they are attacking her was so well shot and the acting was so freaking good. I also cried at the end. But yeah I’m obsessed.

An incredible storm of acting, script, editing and direction; glad to see they were all recognized! It did feel it lose steam through the middle, but that ending and the twisted nightmare of Anora's world by the end of the movie still has my head spinning. But like, cmon man, nobody holds an Xbox controller like that what are we doing here

I felt like we owed Ani more than just pity at the end. She could’ve been a strong protagonist but I can’t help but feel like she was just super naive throughout the whole storyline. This movie didn’t feel like it was really about her. BUT it was still entertaining.
  
  ★     Watched by kh  24 Mar 2025   
A total mess. This film literally tells us nothing about Anora, not her past, her wants, nor her motivations. Comedic as some parts may be, we are not led to any meaningful understanding about the conditions under which sex workers live. We get a lot of footages so explicit that they nearly look like porn, yes, but where is the “advocacy” celebrated by so many really? 
Can’t help but think maybe someone confused 康城 with 日出康城 when they handed out the palme d’or.

  ★★★½      Rewatched by MJD  21 Mar 2025   
Like Giulietta Masina’s Cabiria, Mikey Madison renders Ani with a layered complexity that resists simplification—her sharp self-awareness coexisting with a persistent, if fragile, hope. She embodies this contradiction physically and emotionally, balancing Ani’s guarded resilience with moments of unguarded yearning.
The film thrives on this duality, drawing the audience into Ani’s aspirations while simultaneously deconstructing the American myth of reinvention. Its emotional beats, particularly in its latter half, expose the limits of personal agency within entrenched social and economic structures.…

I cannot understand the praise this movie is getting. It seems like the writer watched Pretty Woman and took it to its logical conclusion by a basic plot about what happens when someone poor marries some rich (cue in some really old Bollywood movies). Some of the dialogues, especially by Vanya are so cringey. Also, let's talk about the lead character... Does Anora have anything she wants in life besides "being in love" with Vanya? Did she have any aspirations…

Wtf"Anora" winning five Oscars is honestly baffling. The story was a complete mess, with a theme that felt pointless and uninspired. Instead of delivering anything meaningful, the film was just packed with unnecessary vulgarity, making it unbearable to watch. How the hell did this even get recognized, let alone win multiple awards? It felt like a joke—more style than substance, and definitely not deserving of all the hype. Total disappointment. 😒I only give it a half a star because its a movie .

Absolutely had me until it's final moments. (That's two internationally praised movies this month, what the fuck?) I don't generally get so turned off just from a movie's ending, but I'll say this for the sole reason that I know he'll get off hearing it: Best picture my ass, Sean Baker. You're getting topped out by 'Wicked' on my list, cuck. 🖕 Madison is innocent; her performance a true representation the indominable spirit of a Brooklynite.

  ★★★★     Watched by Rolando  24 Mar 2025   
A chaotic but sweet unconventional love story (or is it?). Good performance from all involved, filled with drama, humor and emotion. I loved that the writers refrained from making the Russian “heavies” stereotypical goons, nice reprieve. 
“I don’t have Instagram, I’m an adult!” was a low-blow. 😂

En ocasiones caricaturezca. Quizá fue muy pretencioso por parte del equipo querer darle un tinte tanto dramático y a la vez cómico, dado que en algún punto se sacrificó uno de dos. No obstante, la temática no solo es buena sino necesaria. Ojalá se produzcan más filmes de este tipo

This was my second time watching Anora and it was just as good. Biggest difference i saw this time was that I didn't hate Vanya as much. I looked throught the lens of the theory of Blame Relativism when interrupting Vanya's character. As much as I think what Vanya did was wrong, I also can give him so leeway because of his parents. He was never taught how to be a good person growing up, he had no good role…

Do começo pra metade de filme e um lixo, depois começa a ficar espetacular. Achei mt legal os personagens que são introduzidos ao decorrer do filme. A atuação de Mickey Madison foi simplesmente incrível cara, a cena dela desesperada tentando fugir e os caramba é muito boa, a cena final também é daora dms, bom filme, tirando o fato do início ser um porre e parecer um "Euphoria" da vida.

If I'm being completely honest..the first half of the movie to me, feels weak, it doesn't feel like it has much substance and I couldn't connect with the charactersBut then the second half comes around and man... this is what makes the movie incredible, the heart of the movie is here and truly where everyone shines, especially Mikey with her performance.
 IGOR....a character you don't care much for when you first see him but as the movie progresses, even…

La verdad me decepcionó mucho. La trama no parecía ir a ningún lado en ningún momento, solo una noche loca alargada, y para eso veo Hangover y por lo menos me río. 
Los personajes no son profundos, apenas sabemos los nombres de la mayoría y de Anora que es la principal tampoco sabemos nada. Tampoco se desarrollan lo suficiente a lo largo de la película. En una película normalmente vemos a través de los ojos de cierto personaje, o nos…

The story has much potential. I like how they showed the whole story, particularly the sex workers' environment, in a much more darker and explicit way than these kind of movies tend to do soHowever, it was difficult to emphasize with the characters, as they didn't seem to maturely or rationally at all

I wish I could've liked this one more. There's undeniable merit from a filmmaking standpoint, especially in its cinematography and acting. I just couldn't get on board with the film's pacing and didn't have much investment at all in any of the characters, which made it difficult for me to enjoy.

Anora is so strange. This might be the most confused I've ever been when trying to rate a movie on this app. I genuinely have no idea what to think of this movie. I watched this because I saw a lot of positive reviews and I liked Mikey Madsion in Scream 5, but it was not as good as I was expecting. This movie goes on forever and doesn't accomplish much in that runtime. It has some interesting ideas sprinkled…

This movie honestly wasn’t what I was expecting but it was a pretty great movie and Mikey Madison honestly really got that Oscar because her performance was great and the whole look and vibe of this movie was great and honestly Igor was the mvp of this movie this movie was great. 8.5/10

Anora was such a fun tragic, and hilarious story. The home invasion and the manhunt was so enjoyable to watch bro was such a mamas boy

Actually made me so fucking sad, why would he do that to her :(((( crazy how explosive this movie was for the major heartache it revolved around, with all sad emotions compiled at the very end for 30 seconds. I feel like it’s been getting a really bad rep online and in reviews but I really enjoyed it. And I just straight up love her hair glitter

Very interesting all around. Intriguing cinematography. Compelling characters… Planning to watch again, though, as it felt like everything was right in front of me yet just slightly beyond my grasp (in a good way).

I felt like we owed Ani more than just pity at the end. She could’ve been a strong protagonist but I can’t help but feel like she was just super naive throughout the whole storyline. This movie didn’t feel like it was really about her. BUT it was still entertaining.

A total mess. This film literally tells us nothing about Anora, not her past, her wants, nor her motivations. Comedic as some parts may be, we are not led to any meaningful understanding about the conditions under which sex workers live. We get a lot of footages so explicit that they nearly look like porn, yes, but where is the “advocacy” celebrated by so many really? 
Can’t help but think maybe someone confused 康城 with 日出康城 when they handed out the palme d’or.

  ★★★½      Rewatched by MJD  21 Mar 2025   
Like Giulietta Masina’s Cabiria, Mikey Madison renders Ani with a layered complexity that resists simplification—her sharp self-awareness coexisting with a persistent, if fragile, hope. She embodies this contradiction physically and emotionally, balancing Ani’s guarded resilience with moments of unguarded yearning.
The film thrives on this duality, drawing the audience into Ani’s aspirations while simultaneously deconstructing the American myth of reinvention. Its emotional beats, particularly in its latter half, expose the limits of personal agency within entrenched social and economic structures.…

I cannot understand the praise this movie is getting. It seems like the writer watched Pretty Woman and took it to its logical conclusion by a basic plot about what happens when someone poor marries some rich (cue in some really old Bollywood movies). Some of the dialogues, especially by Vanya are so cringey. Also, let's talk about the lead character... Does Anora have anything she wants in life besides "being in love" with Vanya? Did she have any aspirations…

Wtf"Anora" winning five Oscars is honestly baffling. The story was a complete mess, with a theme that felt pointless and uninspired. Instead of delivering anything meaningful, the film was just packed with unnecessary vulgarity, making it unbearable to watch. How the hell did this even get recognized, let alone win multiple awards? It felt like a joke—more style than substance, and definitely not deserving of all the hype. Total disappointment. 😒I only give it a half a star because its a movie .

Absolutely had me until it's final moments. (That's two internationally praised movies this month, what the fuck?) I don't generally get so turned off just from a movie's ending, but I'll say this for the sole reason that I know he'll get off hearing it: Best picture my ass, Sean Baker. You're getting topped out by 'Wicked' on my list, cuck. 🖕 Madison is innocent; her performance a true representation the indominable spirit of a Brooklynite.

A chaotic but sweet unconventional love story (or is it?). Good performance from all involved, filled with drama, humor and emotion. I loved that the writers refrained from making the Russian “heavies” stereotypical goons, nice reprieve. 
“I don’t have Instagram, I’m an adult!” was a low-blow. 😂

En ocasiones caricaturezca. Quizá fue muy pretencioso por parte del equipo querer darle un tinte tanto dramático y a la vez cómico, dado que en algún punto se sacrificó uno de dos. No obstante, la temática no solo es buena sino necesaria. Ojalá se produzcan más filmes de este tipo

This was my second time watching Anora and it was just as good. Biggest difference i saw this time was that I didn't hate Vanya as much. I looked throught the lens of the theory of Blame Relativism when interrupting Vanya's character. As much as I think what Vanya did was wrong, I also can give him so leeway because of his parents. He was never taught how to be a good person growing up, he had no good role…

Do começo pra metade de filme e um lixo, depois começa a ficar espetacular. Achei mt legal os personagens que são introduzidos ao decorrer do filme. A atuação de Mickey Madison foi simplesmente incrível cara, a cena dela desesperada tentando fugir e os caramba é muito boa, a cena final também é daora dms, bom filme, tirando o fato do início ser um porre e parecer um "Euphoria" da vida.

Los personajes no son profundos, apenas sabemos los nombres de la mayoría y de Anora que es la principal tampoco sabemos nada. Tampoco se desarrollan lo suficiente a lo largo de la película. En una película normalmente vemos a través de los ojos de cierto personaje, o nos…
