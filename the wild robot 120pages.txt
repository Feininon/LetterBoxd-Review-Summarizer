The Wild Robot (2024)
When it comes to animated family movies I sometimes find it difficult to discern between 'saccharine' and 'shit'. I think the reason is that because most utterly terrible movies, be they Dreamworks, Disney, Pixar, or any other animated studio, tend to be overly twee by proxy. In this way I've kind of classically conditioned myself to start to be put off by a film once it begins to lean in to the 'listen to your heart'…

es hermoso presenciar esta nueva etapa de la animación. Que hermoso uso de texturas y estilos, un verdadero trabajo artesanal que resalta las posibilidades infinitas de crear y no las cierra en un solo medio. para mi sorpresa fue una bella historia con la cantidad suficiente de drama, comedia y fantasia. yo tambien creo que somos algo más alla de lo que los demas puedan decir o mejor dicho podemos hacer más de lo que nos dijeron que estamos "programados" para hacer

This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.
This gets my vote for the best animated film of 2024! The Wild Robot was a heartwarming story about the beauty and frustrations of sacrifice, friendship, motherhood, and love. There were countless touching moments in this film, but my favorites were Brightbill’s training sequence and when Roz reboots at the end purely through the power of love. I was a bit disappointed with how quickly the movie concluded when Roz decided to leave the island, but I’ve decided this is not enough to deduct half a star from an otherwise perfect movie.

Almost categorically familiar, but its sense of focus – and the focal point itself, namely, otherness – is valuable enough to dispel the déjà vu while viewing. (Of course, it also boasts a charming main character: Roz is quite a worthy object, literally, to champion. Voiced by Lupita Nyong’o, she harnesses curiosity and empathy like a human. More on that below.) Animation style is, as Ollie pointed out, somewhat singular, and painterly (it wisely chucks that at times, to heighten…

"Fly like you, not like them"
If I told teenage me that in 10-15 years he'd be talking about DreamWorks as the saviours if modern animation, I'd probably look at myself like I was mental, and then go moan on Tumblr about it.
Anyway, point is, DreamWorks have stepped the fuck up in terms of the animation in their movies recently, and long may it continue. This is gorgeous, and some of the lighting, especially in the finale... fuck.
Struggling…

This is my only issue with this movie, we're shown scenes of extreme animalxanimal violence from the very beginning since it's how nature is and that's perfectly normal. But then what will happen to carnivorous animal after the movie ? 
You can't make us believe animals can coexist without violence when you show us a real depiction of nature first and actually mention it in the movie.
Otherwise, gorgeous, amazing score and characters.

I came into this movie with high expectations given the high score. I definitely wasn’t let down the animation style was great and the overall story was good too. Why does every fox character always slap in these movies. There was a few jokes in this movie I did actually find funny and had me giggling. Storyline was very predictable and is definitely aimed towards kids which is fine. Overall a solid movie.

Duele saber que es la última película que hará DreamWorks por si solo. Una película bellísima, tanto en los temas que trata, como en su animación. La historia es la de un robot que por error cae en un bosque, en donde deberá tratar con los animales y cuidar de un ganso a medida que crece.
El film es un claro retrato en la naturaleza y la vida en sí. Más allá de ser una película orientada a un público…

fazia tempo que uma animação (sem ser do studio ghibli) me emocionava assim! animação super bem feita e história linda e emocionante. tanta sinceridade, e de forma singela consegue passar uma mensagem muito linda, principalmente para as crianças que precisam ver coisas para apresender desde cedo! usando coisas da atualidade, como a tecnologia, e a questão ambiental, conseguiu criar algo lindo nessa união. além de super engraçado também! quando não estava chorando, estava rindo.

the way i was genuinely inconsolable for like 80% of this film is crazy. like the way i was crying at bits that i had truly no business crying at is honestly kinda hilarious, maybe it was the sleep deprivation, maybe it was the 8 hour shift i had just worked, but also maybe it was because this was just so, SO good.

Numerous Amazing touching moments with an incredible art style that matches the story told.
The only down point is the amount of topics packed inside this single movie. But is it negative… probably not in this rare movie case.

  ★★★½     Watched by OsianGT25  29 Oct 2024   
What a beautifully animated film!The music’s also a standout by blending a mix of tracks and actual score.I’ve seen “the wild robot” thousands of times before because it uses loads of common movie tropes, but that isn’t really a fault for the film. It utilises creativity with the robot’s abilities in new circumstances, with humour also done well.Worth a watch, you might even shed a tear!

I never thought migration would make me almost shed a tear, but here we are.
This film is genuinely so good. Not even good, it’s great. I can’t say that it’s my favourite film of all time, but I can say I can’t think of anything that would make it better, and I honestly really just want to watch it all over again which to me feels like it can’t get much higher praise than that. It’s gorgeous, it’s heartfelt,…

There is something disturbing about the anthropomorphization of animals which kept bugging me the entire film. The use animals to portray some of the problems of modern society while, in the real world, animals have been displaced from our lives is a sad realization. This reminded me of the words of the great John Berger:
The cultural marginalization of animals is, of course, a more complex process than their physical marginalization. The animals of the mind cannot be easily dispersed.…

При всей моей любви ко второй Головоломке и большому респекту Трансформерам Один, но в анимации лучше Дикого робота в этом году ничего не вышло. Это потрясающий мультик, который несмотря на схематичную предсказуемость сюжета, блестяще работает в необычном сеттинге, попадает в актуальность наших дней и эмоционально бьёт куда необходимо. Фильм также безупречно нарисован (здесь очень много крутых и сочных кадров), а также отлично звучит (отмечу классную основную тему). Поймал себя на мысли, что именно такой мультфильм мог бы выйти от праймового…

Longest short film I've ever seen.
I found this quite affecting despite being a #robothater, and though my mother described it as "quite cheesy", I found myself taking everything at face an enjoying it. It is rare for our reactions to be this way around.I thought the first five or ten minutes did not have a very enjoyable rythm, and it felt like it failed to decide between beats of repose and constant motion. But once the story got…

Deserving of the hype, it ticks all the boxes across the board to qualify it is a future classic in the animation genre. The animation on the humans was shockingly bad but when the rest is so shockingly good who even cares? This is the type of animated movie that handles its messages in a subtle way that educates children, in fact it reminded me a lot of early Pixar work in that way. I like this new direction for Dreamworks and it seems to be working. In this instance it worked amazingly, as a kid’s film I really couldn’t ask for much more.

Better than I was expecting! Nice to see something that wasn't Disney or Marvel, or a reboot. The visuals were good, and I liked the design of the robot. The sub-plot about the humans wanting the robot back didn't make sense, as they seemed to be fine without it. And a needlessly fraught final act. But overall i'd watch it again with my kids

A stunning piece of modern family animation. DreamWorks is really working lately. The use of colour and attention to detail is truly quite stunning. So many sweet moments accentuated by carefully crafted scenery. The design is simply wonderful. Plot and dialogue wise it isn’t the most complicated or dramatic or nuanced (though there is some nuance) but it is technically targeted at children, so if you remember that it is not a problem. And sometimes you only need something simple. A lovely watch I would recommend seeing :)

Cried more times than i can remember. Such a beautiful, heartfelt film with stellar animation, mesmerizing visual story telling and just overall fantastic direction. You can tell everyone who worked on this movie had nothing but love and passion for it and they did a wonderful job.P.S: Dreamworks will put out Puss in Boots 2, then Megamind 2, then this. Such an odd stuido when it comes to consistent quality.

this movie is such an emotional movie. it’s not just sad because something bad happens at the end. the whole story is this mix of happy and sad that really pulls at your heart. it’s one of those movies that makes you want to smile and cry at the same time. Pedro Pascal did an amazing job, bringing so much warmth to his character (unlike chris pratt where he doesn’t even voice act he just talks normally). this is a beautiful, unforgettable movie that really touches you.

“Sometimes hearts have their own conversations”
Everything about this movie is beautiful. The story, the animation, the voice acting, the score. 
I appreciated the post-credit scene as it gave me a chance to wipe the tears from my eyes while I sat through the credits. 
Simply stunning.

A beautiful movie! There is much character in how it was styled and portrayed. One of my favorite movie series growing up was How to Train Your Dragon so I was very excited to see this movie. However, it did not connect to me as much as I hope it would. I could not keep serious and was laughing a lot, especially when they started to howl together LOL. A lighthearted feels-good movie but I imagined it to be somewhat different.

The Top 200  #193
The first 40 minutes were pretty poor. They relied on every cliché, the dialogue was poor and voice acting wasn’t great but it quickly picked itself up afterwards. It became its own film without relying too much on clichés, the dialogue was solid and the voice acting was good. It even had me emotionally invested in some points but I’m still waiting for the first film to make me cry. The animation is stunning all throughout and the story is entertaining

Érrr, quem nasceu para ser Disney jamais será DreamWorks. Essa animação é bastante diferente do que a indústria cultural estadunidense vinha entregando ultimamente. Esse longa consegue trazer elementos novos e prender o público com uma história que foge da superficialidade que esse gênero está subordinado atualmente. Embora eu tenha isso em mente, não é cabível dar uma nota máxima, tendo em vista os problemas do enredo. Sei que é chato e talvez até insensível da minha parte, mas o principal…

The animation is stunning and the colours vibrant. This was a pretty standard “tugging on the heart strings” story to be honest but the execution was anything but …… it was truly amazing. The music certainly helped cue up the outpouring of emotion simply demanded by the film……I didn’t disappoint. I guess as a parent I could empathise with what the robot was going through but this is a film for everyone, young and old. A very solid watch and very enjoyable 😀

The Wild Robot is an utter delight of a film. A rare animation that feels immediately reminiscent of childhood trauma caused by Walt Disney films. 
It’s rare that a film can make you smile, laugh, thrill and cry with both happiness and sadness all in one sub-two-hour running time and yet some how writer-director Chris Sanders has achieved exactly that.
It feels like a middle-finger to the algorithm led world we live in. We, like the titular character have been…

La trama original, los diálogos mostrando un pensamiento 50% humano, un 50% animal, hacen de la experiencia un momento más que entretenido. Los diferentes mensajes caben tanto para mentes de nenes como de adultos, tanto en la generalidad de la humanidad como en lo intrapersonal. Fue lindo verla con mis sobrinitas.

Although I'd love it to take a bit more time to reflect on itself and take a moment to breathe - its more pixar then Ghibli - this is gorgeous stuff. Children's fiction is so much richer when love goes into it and Sanders, his animators and the stellar voice cast pour their souls into it. Love it.

Wish I could see it in theatres,that would have been amazing but life isn't fair and I had to watch it on my phone at last but even then I enjoyed this film so muchhh!!what a great day to have eyes and a pair of quality earbuds otherwise the score wouldn't have hit that much and the score is so fucking beautiful even the song 'kiss the sky' made me feel so motivated and emotional.My favourite funny moment is when the otter says "shh the jerk wants to speak"🗣️😂

this is one of the most emotionally intelligent animated films ever
every single character is so likeable and easy to empathise with, done justice by the fairly stacked cast involved, with an endearing, heartfelt plot that i have no shame in admitting had me on the verge of tears
there's so many profound and meaningful things to take away from this film, it has a message for anyone who watches and it delivers those messages phenomenally, wrapped up in some great animation
100% worth a watch

“Sometimes, hearts have their own conversations.”
Bold in that it doesn't shy away from the unforgiving nature of...nature. The first hour of The Wild Robot is a truly beautiful, honest, sometimes crushing take on both the hardships and rewards of parenthood. The often unforgiving and overwhelming choices you and your partner have to make in choosing to take the tougher, more difficult but ultimately more rewarding path in favor of the dismissive, absent option that undoubtedly causes lifelong repercussions is…

After a 2nd viewing this is definitely my favorite film of the year so far. Having bottled my emotions for the past 2 weeks and being able to let it all out was something I really needed. Thank you DreamWorks for making me believe there's light at the end of the tunnel and I shouldn't just quit and end things

Somehow convinced my mother to watch this with me. I didn't know about the familial dynamic in the film because I stayed away from the trailers.Yeah.Sprinkle in a bit of found family and suddenly we're crying in the club
The concept artists on this must have had fun. The rate of evolution of visual techniques is quite astonishing because in a span of less than a decade, there's been more leaps made than in the last 40yrs. The score is amazing! Kris Bowers has beefed up his resume and hope he gets more recognition

Bueno bueno bueno 
Hacía tiempo que no disfrutaba tanto una película de animación
No quiero enrollarme, visualmente es preciosa, la historia es brutal, no se hace para nada pesada y narra todo de manera exquisita. 
Ahora lo más importante, es una película que te hace sentir muchas cosas, y a mí personalmente ha conseguido emocionarme, aborda muy bien el tema del amor, las amistades, el “propuse” de la gente…
Creo que todo el mundo debería ver esta película

This movie is visually stunning and full of heart. It's sure to be an instant classic. There are so many great shots and the story is wholesome through and through, with many moments that will make you tear up. At times it did feel a tad like a generic children's movie, mostly when the titular wild robot is off-screen and we're left with the talking animals, but those moments are kept to a minimum. The first 15 minutes are mostly…

Unexpected humor. Odd animation style, sort of impressionist. My daughter LOVES this movie. Cried over it. In consecutive days. We watched it together last night. I disappointed her by repeatedly falling asleep during the movie, so I watched it again. And fell asleep again (don’t tell my daughter). But I rewound and finished it. 
The names of the characters reminded me of the Land Before Time series. My daughter was right. This was a good movie. And that last line, “And you can call me Roz,” was a tear jerker.

The Wild Robot absolutely blew my socks off. I'd been excited for this from the first trailer, mind you - the art style was instantly eye-catching and the premise is very much my jam - but this absolutely exceeded even my wildest expectations. This is one of the best family films in the last decade, and easily the best animated film of the year so far.
Let's start with the obvious: visuals. The Wild Robot is easily one of…

Un très beau film. Ça m’a fait du bien de retrouver un DreamWorks comme ceux de mon enfance. Remplie de sagesse, de sensibilité, de douceur, de justesse dans ce qu’impliquent les liens mères-enfants et la période adolescente qui cherche son identité et qui a besoin de trouver un regard similaire au sien. Ce film questionne tant de choses, à savoir le besoin d’exister à travers les attentes et demandes des autres, la desidentification à sa mère et l’importance du regard…

L'histoire est toute simple, toute mignonne avec ce robot qui apprend à vivre dans la nature. C'est par moment émouvant.Les dessins sont superbes, très moderne avec ce mélange de 3d, de 2d, d'aquarelles...Mais malheureusement le scénario est plein d'incohérences... Le principe de base est de montrer la vie sauvage telle qu'elle est vraiment : la dure loi de la nature. Idée géniale, avec ses scènes humour noir d'animaux tout mignons qui se font manger. Autre idée brillante :…

BAWLED my eyes out
This is the most beautiful movie I've seen this year by far in terms of visuals and scoring. The animation is so incredibly stunning and the music is just as hard hitting to match. Though the story is fairly simple, its execution can make the toughest man cry (me).
I had such a wonderful time watching this and genuinely laughing at all the silly jokes. The acting is so good too, each character feels so unique and fun to learn about. This could be dreamworks' magnum opus, if Shrek didn't exist.

There are very beautiful scenes both for the tender moments, both for the comical ones, both for the spectacular ones. I really liked the animations: it is not in fact the usual CGI animated film: to a hyper-defined and rounded look it prefers a light blur and colors applied without outlines, creating almost pictorial images and certainly more artistic and fascinating than the usual standard.
As for me, I find that, despite touching on very beautiful themes and representing…

The plot is really sweet, and there were multiple moments as a grown ass man in the theater that I was surprised by how emotional and touched I was. Definitely a feel good movie.

Yes I did actually watch it again, something which I rarely ever do with movies I watched, and it was just as peak as it was the first time, if not better. I went to see it this time with a group of friends, and they also thought it was fantastic, proving how amazing this film is. Everything I said in my original review is accurate, except for my comment about the pacing in the first third, which I did not find to be a problem at all this time around. Again, please go watch this.

The same style in animation that is used in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish with wonderful colours and beautiful imagery. It’s a story that is about learning to adapt to new surroundings, learning how to parent and to accept others for their differences.It just reminded me of a better and more fleshed out version of Migration, but I still won’t find this memorable and unlikely to revisit in a hurry.

Adapted from a children’s novel by Peter Brown, writer and director Chris Sanders gives us the perfect combination of laughs and emotion in The Wild Robot with a story that tugs at the heartstrings, or should that be power cables? It is Dreamwork’s deepest film for many years and possibly their most ground breaking in animation too giving us a film that revels in the natural world showcasing it’s beauty and ingeniously demonstrating it’s brutality in a family friendly but…

With wry, almost gallows humor, visual panache and an impressive voice cast, co-writer/director Chris Sanders adapts Peter Brown's illustrated middle grades book into a tale of finding family and coming together as a community. 
A talented voice cast deepens the film’s effect. Lupita Nyong’o effortlessly treads the line between logic and longing with so graceful a character arc that you can feel Roz growing beyond her programming. Pedro Pascal joins her as Fink, the fox who hates to admit that…

This film (cringe alert) was an emotional rollercoaster to me personally, I am someone who is a sucker for kindness and unconditional love and this movie portrayed these values excellently, and there were multiple moments in the movie were I teared up a little.

The attention to detail in the character animation and the textures and background art was amazing. The soundtrack was wonderful :,) made me cry like a lil bitch.
 Did feel fast paced at times but it is for younger audiences but all the necessary ends tied together in the end in a simple and sweet way :)

The Wild Robot brings Peter Brown’s story to the screen with a visual and emotional intensity that only Chris Sanders could pull off. Known for Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, Sanders has always excelled at creating heartfelt connections between characters and worlds that feel genuine. Here, he pushes that to a new level, letting the island become an almost primal force that Roz, the robot, must learn to survive in and adapt to. It’s not just an…

Belíssima animação, longe de ser um filme infantil, entrega uma história com  bastante emoção e personagens muito interessantes, com suas angústias e conflitos. E por mais contra-senso que pareça, é um filme sobre relações humanas na essência (ainda que não tenha um humano sequer).Em um ano sem Divertidamente 2, acho que seria favoritaço ao Oscar.

Émouvant, magnifique, exceptionnel… un film dreamworks qui fait du bien visuellement avec des très belle mise en scène, une belle histoire touchante qui peut faire couler une petite larme, une musique qui convient bien. Ce robot : Roz qui apprend à vivre avec cette nature et ses animaux pour élever son petit permet de développer plein de thèmes intéressant ; la maternité, la mort, vivre en société… une pépite tout simplement.

I expected a cute family movie, but I did not expect a hall of famer robot, going down with the greats like Wall-E, The Iron Giant, and Baymax as insanely adorable and relatable bots. 
Made me want to give my mother the biggest hug ever. And it doesn’t save all the emotional swings for the end, you get hit throughout. That’s what makes the ending that much more worth it

He de decir que pensé la trama sería algo muy diferente a lo que terminó siendo por lo que mi sorpresa con al película fue aún mayor conforme se desarrollaba y ver temas como la maternidad o la amabilidad que siento se abordan bien para ser entendidos tanto por niños como por los adultos, incluso…

I love how this film explores ideas of motherhood, kindness and love.

The animation, the soundtrack, the concepts: perfection.

3 hours after coming out of the theatre and I'm still blown away by that flight training in the runway scene, the migration scene, and that butterfly scene (you would not believe your eyes, if ten million butterflies~)
Lupita Nyong'o was unbelievably good in this! and I didn't realize that there was Pedro Pascal, Stephanie Hsu, etc. until I saw the credit scene. maan I sure hope this movie gets the awards it…

Otherwise it was really good compared to a kids movie it was really touching and it has many valuable lessons like expressing your feelings to ppl u luv before it's too late + accepting other ppl difference's and most importantly being kind to them , and I'm so glad that it wasn't talking about those stuff u know the LGBTQ kinda things like other movies does

The human condition through the eyes of a robot and animals. If you're looking for warmth, connection and optimism, watch this. And to whoever composed this soundtrack - fuck you man. How dare you demolish me and the 6 year old next to me who was absolutely bawling her eyes out? If this doesn't win best original song at the Oscars, there's gonna be violence.
Officially the 5th ever movie to make me tear up. It could've done without the last 20 minutes, but I'm not mad at it considering the target audience. Probably the best dreamworks movie aside from shrek 2. Nothing beats shrek 2.

The drama is powerful but casts a false shadow on the butchered world! The animals are us in a 1-1, it's the cascading failure of our ecosystems that allows this Habermasian pedagogy of self-discovery in the community to flourish. It portrays a world without animals or robots, a blockbuster developmental therapy simulacrum

Dreamworks created the Venn diagram for “movies with zero sentimentality”, “movies that make you cry” and “movies that offer an unflinching vision of a post global warming future, then move on without even waiting for your heart to finish breaking”.

I am NOT immune to animated animals.
Wonderful seeing Dreamworks continue tapping into the vivid animation style they’ve been exploring, this film legitimately looks stunning. I asore the care put into how each character moves as well, be it the multitude of animals or the very creative build of Roz.
The story, I imagine, is easy for kids to follow along with, but the execution remains sufficiently poignant to keep me teary eyed throughout pretty much the entire thing. I just love the power of kinship despite and because of our differences okay!!

damn first puss in boots and now this? 
such a simple plot but man the execution here is so amazing and beautiful and everything. somehow this manages to be better than puss in boots and hopefully we see more of roz's story in the future
(the music in the montage and somehow all of the songs with lyrics sounds like tinkerbell and that's exactly the kind of music i love)

Best kiddie tearjerker in a minute (adopts the Pixar approach of aiming over the youngsters’ heads and straight for the heartstrings of parents) but I think I enjoyed this more for its potpourri of genre. There’s fish-out-of-water comedy, odd couple dynamics, a sports movie montage, and a Wall•E-esque parable about community and free choice in the face of lobotomized living. Also struggling to recall another recent mainstream animated film that is this honest and aware about the dangers of the…

Just here to cynically joke/ posit that this movie is a psyop promoting carbon capture technology as the answer to man-made climate change.
A (flooded) Silicon Valley robot and tree-felling literally save the day.  
Very accomplished if not a little manufactured in its saccharine ode to motherhood. Speaking of which, I love my mum and will be taking her to see Terrifier 3 tomorrow because she’s cool.

The Wild Robot is about Roz, an intellectual robot found stranded on an island commuted by strictly animals, who finds herself/itself in a position to care for a goose that has lost his family as a result of an accident.
The trailers for this film showed off its potential but, I'd be damned, I wasn't expecting this and Dreamworks Animation has bounced back from Kung Fu Panda 4. Stylistically similiar yet different from their other surprise hit within the last…

honestly an incredible movie and i will be buying the book. i cried so many times. this film has a really interesting and unique plot and i think they ended it really well. i like the humour and the jokes roz makes. dreamworks is making its comeback after like 15 years. i’m enjoying the fact that they’re making new content and not just kung fu panda 7 for no reason.
overall one of the best films that i have watched in a  very long time. would definitely watch again.

Some people are not fans of animated films. They are often dismissed as lesser versions of live action and therefore not taken seriously.This attitude can be extremely frustrating when animated films can be so rich in content and tell us so much about ourselves, often more so than any live action film ever could.When Wall-E first arrived in our consciousness, it gave us an insight in to what life could look like if we failed to take care…

dreamworks does it again! (makes me sob hysterically). there’s just something about a robot character feeling so out of place in society and has to learn how to function normally like everyone else while simultaneously being laughed at and looked down on condescendingly and when presented with how you should function in said society you somehow get it wrong every time 🥰🥰 hm so relatable wonder why 🧐

A magical menagerie must learn to accept the gifts of a mechanical castaway in DreamWorks’ deftly realised cartoon.
No sooner has one robot-themed cartoon bit the box-office dust than another moves into its place. But unlike Transformers One, DreamWorks Animation’s The Wild Robot is a total original. Well, if one is willing to overlook its similarities to Bambi, E.T., The Iron Giant, Cast Away, WALL-E and Migration, it is as original as it gets. Adapted from Peter Brown’s picture book of the same name, The Wild Robot addresses many culturally sensitive concerns and does so with heart, pace and expertise.

As someone currently struggling with depression and anxiety, The Wild Robot was a very pivotal film in my recovery so far. While I haven’t been able to fully “feel” happiness or true sadness lately, this film conveyed a beautiful and original story engaged my feelings on overdrive as it did for many others.  Yeah i totally teared up at the end because I never thought that I’d see technology/ai be reinvigorated in an animated film the way it was in The Wild Robot. 🤖

Un très bon exemple de bande annonce qui ne me donnait pas du tout envie et finalement ... Et bien j'ai vraiment aimé !Chez DreamWorks ils sont doués pour faire des films pour enfant avec une lecture drôle pour les adultes aussi.Plein de thèmes sont abordés, l'adoption, le harcèlement, la différence, la solidarité, la mort. Il y a de beaux messages sans être niais. Visuellement c'est très beau. Depuis le Chat Potté 2 pour DreamWorks et à la base depuis Spider-Man : New-Geneation, le style d'animation mêlant 2D et 3D a explosé, pour notre plus grand plaisir !

I have more thoughts than this, cause its a good movie, but the Pedro Pascal character/performance is so off putting to me, it knocks the whole thing down at least 1.5 stars. Its just nonstop Ryan Reynolds tuned to 9 year olds by AI. I hated it. Recut this without the whole character this is top 10 of the year.

Absolutely beautiful animation with an amazing heart touching story. It may have some story beats reminiscent of some other movies but it's executed flawlessly and doesn't take away from the experience at all. Had tears in my eyes several times throughout the movie and that's rare for any movie. Highly recommend, one of DreamWorks' best.

This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.
In 1816, 18 year-old Marry Shelley tapped into her culture's inchoate fears of the burgeoning advancements in science and the threat they posed to humanity, and created one of the all-time great works of literature, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Her work has terrorized us for two centuries with dire warnings about what happens when our scientific reach exceeds our grasp. I wonder what she would think about artificial intelligence. Would she have written The Terminator, or Blade Runner? Perhaps…

Kind of like a modern day Iron Giant (1999) and not just because of the robot. The Wild Robot is a beautifully animated movie that's funny and engaging for grown-ups and kids alike (or I'd like to believe kids would enjoy it). At times it takes on a surprising edge that I would welcome in more family films today. It reminded me of the kind of story you could see in movies pre 2000. Though, I think they could have committed to a more melancholy ending, but sometimes you can't have it all. Big recommend from me :)

Half term movie time with one of the kids! This is a joyful triumph about parenthood, purpose, sacrifice and cooperation. I loved the art style, almost painterly yet detailed and the surprisingly macabre sense of humour. In a small screening with lots of pretty small children, they all seemed utterly engrossed and Theo said it was epic and loved it.

We are controlled by own instincts,but we survived because of our own intuitions.The Wild Robot succeeds in that. 
Chris Sanders has nailed it again, officially creating three wonderful animated films in three separate decades. From co-directing Lilo & Stich (2002) and How to Train Your Dragon (2010) with Dean Deblois to dealing with his subpar films (The Croods (2013) and The Call of the Wild (2020)) without Dean Deblois' help, he has finally found his own footing, directing his…

Finn's first movie theatre experience!!!
As expected, he loved it. At one point I was watching him more than watching the actual movie and he told me to move out of the way so he could see 😅
The trailer for Paddington 3 came on before the movie and he probably talked about going to see that more than The Wild Robot.
  
  ★★★★★      Watched by Ismail Khilath Rasheed  29 Oct 2024   
Based on the popular children's book of the same name by Peter Brown and being a hardcore fan of Chris Sanders’ “Lilo & Stitch”, “The Wild Robot” brimming with human warmth went beyond my expectations. 
I liked the fact that the story is candid and doesn’t pretend that the cruelty of Nature doesn’t exist as depicted in the existence of the food chain for the survival of all living beings.
I liked the film’s exploration of themes of friendship, resilience, and…

My favorite movie of 2024 by far. I thought it would be corny about half of the way through, but I ended up getting emotional five times. This is a very strong effort from Dreamworks and sits up there with some of their best movies.

While the tropes have been troped since the beginning of animated film, this movie manages to refresh what we've seen so many times. Stunning animation. Cute fuzzy little animals. Great casting. All of this comes together to give us another take on the value of togetherness amongst diversity. Awww.

A bit clichéd, yes. But it’s much more touching and impactful environmental storytelling than James Cameron’s Avatar. 
There’s also some really wonderful animation. I love the way the environment and the background of shots looks almost like it’s been painted impressionistically. Unfortunately, that style isn’t applied to the whole shot. 
Nevertheless, a very heartwarming watch!

PERO QUE BONITO POR DIOS!!! Como DreamWorks es capaz de hacer peliculones cuando de verdad se lo propone. Es una propuesta muy innovadora el ver la conexión entre máquinas y la naturaleza.
Tmbn considero que trata muy bien la maternidad y el "volar del nido" de los hijos, aspecto a poder enfocar en una clase de niños de infantil.

Trés belle histoire, avec une belle animation. Je n'ai pas particulièrement été touché par le robot, ce qui ne m'a pas permis de rentrer pleinement dedans, mais j'ai senti une réelle volonté de créer une histoire émouvante et originale. Rien de révolutionnaire non plus, mais un film bien rythmé qui aborde des sujets liés à la parentalité, le vivre-ensemble, la nature et l'adolescence. Plutôt incontournable pour les enfants.

The Wild Robot soars to emotional highs, but crash-landed in the end.
The first 2/3rds of the film was a 3 act structure and self-contained story. It was moving, funny, heart-wrenching, sentimental, and fantastic. 5 stars for this
The last 3rd of the movie is an entirely different 3-act structure that is a messy action movie with several separate plot threads. 2 stars for the ending.
Still, I liked it quite a bit.

This was a wonderful surprise. I laughed a lot, I cried even more, I was in awe of it's beautiful imagery and I bopped to the soundtrack. Has important messages and life lessons without ever being preachy. The voice cast is starry but they are all well cast and actually add dimensions to their characters. Influences of Wall-E, The Jungle Book, The Iron Giant, Silent Running, Wolfwalkers, Studio Ghibli, the paintings of Monet and Winnie The Pooh to name but a few. All of which are great places to draw inspiration from. Easily one of the best original animated movies from a Western Studio in years.

Truly MesmerizingJust hand over the Oscar, Now!I was upset earlier this year when Across The Spider Verse lost their very much deserved Oscar, but if I’ll witness the same thing happen to The Wild Robot next year I’m gonna have a existential breakdown.I’m to emotionally drained to wright a review at this point, but I’ve never witnessed my lips quiver this intensely from pure heartfelt emotions, to the brink of triggering muscle spasms. It felt like a adrenaline rush filled with Heart and TearsThis made me think about my own lifeThank you

This is easily one of the year's most touching and visually stunning films.
Directed by animation veteran Chris Sanders—known for Lilo & Stitch (2002) and How to Train Your Dragon (2010)—this feels like his most accomplished work yet.
One of the standout choices was adopting an animation style reminiscent of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022), which I found visually thrilling. The animation feels raw yet beautifully vibrant, showcasing DreamWorks’ continued evolution with rich, colorful detail.

honestly, there were enough flaws in the movie that i think i would've given it 3 or 3,5 stars, but the fact that it is fucking gorgeous, looks so unique and distinct, earns the…

Tokyo International Film Festival 2024 #2
After all the praise but a Japanese release in 2025 I was always going to catch the film at this festival, but I'm surprised to say it left me feeling rather cold once all was said and done.
The issue is that it's 80% of the way there, and rather than trust the audience to go the other 20% it overexplains everything, heavy-handedly dumping dialogue and forceful music to attempt to force an emotion…

Nice try Dreamworks but I'm still doubling single mother's rent.
This was the first time that I took a kid that I cared about to the movies and he sorta hated the film bc he wouldn't stand still and kept asking if it was almost over every 2 minutes, but when I asked him if he liked it he said yea, so that's a win on my book!

Sério, que animação fofa, profunda e engraçada (sim, tudo ao mesmo tempo). A relação que a roz vai criando com os animais é bastante genuína e a sua evolução de IA pra algo mais sentimental, selvagem e institivo é lindo de ver. Achei mt genial e única a forma q a natureza é retratada nessa animação, tipo acho q eh uma das poucas vezes em que a morte e a vida selvagem são expostas tão cruamente e com tanta naturalidade.…

Wasn’t expecting a cartoon robot to sum up parenting better than just about any human I’ve ever met but there you go…the magic of cinema!
This was great. Something fresh, fun and overflowing with heart. And my son enjoyed it too - even if he wasn’t entirely satisfied with the ending…but it gave us lots to talk about and ponder.

I really enjoyed the first half of this movie, a terrific storyline so well delivered with plenty of humour.  But the introduction of the fighting robots in the second half was disappointing, I am sure this could have been avoided whilst maintaining the same story arch.  However, overall this is a wonderful film, fantastic animation and the voice cast was excellent - I loved Bill Nighy.  A great fair well from Dream Works.

my cousin was too young to watch smile 2 so we had to watch this lil gem.
unfortunately i did hav lil 2-5 min naps throughout the middle portion of the film but i did wake up to an epic latter half.
it was emotional, insightful, thought-provoking, tear jerking, the lot. beautifully animated and great story :’).

A simply beautiful and exceptionally crafted film about how family and love, however mismatched transcends all. The animation is stellar, you fall in love with all the characters in 2 minutes flat and there's something amazing about a film making you cry like a baby in a cinema with 25 other complete strangers. An experience like no other!
A must watch, staggering achievement in animation that is one of Dreamworks absolute best. I feel a 5 is only a matter of time.

Une histoire émouvante (et bien écrite) qui met surtout en avant la beauté d’élever un enfant.
Mais ce film nous fait passer pleins d’autres messages : l’importance de l’amour, de rester soi même, de la gentillesse, mais surtout d’apprendre des autres.

Best animation movie of 2024 by far. 6 goosebumps 3 cries. with my favorite crybaby
  
     Watched by anybodyoutthere  27 Oct 2024   
Overall, it was cliché and lacked a bit of substance. I thought we were gonna see the relationship between Roz and Brightbill grow.. they basically skipped it all. 
The score was good, but I felt like it was imploring me to feel what the creators thought I ought to be, rather than assisting the narrative.
But still I had a nice time and visually it was fantastic. The opening of the movie gripped me with its intensity. 
…
Also, the entire ecosystem is gonna be so messed up now that they’re all friends. What are they gonna eat?

Despite how great Puss in Boots: The Last Wish turned out to be, I don't often find that DreamWorks films feature stunning visuals, charming characters, and moments liable to jerk tears from kids and grown-ups alike. The Wild Robot is an exception. Watching the titular robot learn to coexist with the wildlife on an uninhabited island is highly compelling, and it's hard to look away from the film's gorgeous hand-painted aesthetic. The voice acting is expressive, particularly from Lupita Nyong'o,…

Perso je l'ai regardé le soir et j'ai trouvé que y avait une bonne ambiance.
Film en 2D/3D, comme le dernier film des Tortues Ninja qui était en animation.

This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.
I was gonna give this 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗 because the chick getting launched into the sky and stolen by an eagle only to magically reappear in the next shot made me irrationally angry and ready to check out because I thought the rest of the movie was going to be cheap punchlines like that. But obviously I was pleasantly surprised, and on top of that it made me cry a couple times so I think it got the half star back.

นี่ไม่โกรธนะถ้าเด็กจะดูแล้วส่งเสียง อยู่ไม่สุข มันช่วยไม่ได้ แต่เอาไปเอามาอีพ่ออีแม่พูดมากกว่าเด็กอีก 🫠 พวกหล่อนต้องเป็นตัวอย่างให้เด็กสิวะะะะ นี่โรงหนังเด้อไม่ใช้ดูทีวีอยู่บ้าน…
ส่วนหนังนี่ก็…โอเคมั้ง เปิดมานึกว่าจะมาเวย์ Flow ละ Adventure ขายวิช่วล บรรยากาศ พอดูไปเรื่อยๆกลายเป็นเรื่องผจญภัย วิช่วลบรรยากาศเบาลงเน้นประเด็น แมสเสจมากขึ้น ซึ่งนี่ก็ไม่ติดนะ ที่ติดคือหนังมันใจร้อนไปหน่อย(เรื่องที่แล้วก็ใจร้อนเรื่องนี้ก็ใจร้อน 😂) ส่วนตัวคิดว่าก่อนจะไปถึงจุดแตกหักมันอาจจะจำเป็นต้องมีพาร์ทที่ใช้เวลาด้วยกันมากกว่านี้อ่ะ อันนี้ช่วงเด็ก->โตมันจัมพ์ไปเลยอ่ะ กลายเป็นไม่คล้อยตามเท่าไหร่
ไม่ค่อยชอบที่รอสต้องพิสูจน์ตัวเองเพื่อจะเป็นที่ยอมรับเท่าไหร่เลยอ่ะ ยิ่งมาอยู่ในการ์ตูนเด็กยิ่งน่าหวั่นใจ เหมือนหนังกำลังบอกเด็กๆว่าหากพวกเธอแตกต่างพวกเธอต้องพลีกายถวายชีพเพื่อส่วนรวมน๊สังคมถึงจะหันมาโอบรับพวกเธอ 😨😨😨😨 คือก็ไม่ได้บอกว่าต้องสวยงามเปิดรับความแตกต่างโดยไม่มีข้อแม้ แต่เลือดตกยางออกเพื่อได้รับการยอมรับนี่มันก็… ไม่รู้ดิอันนี้เป็นความกังวลส่วนตัวกับหนังที่เจาะทาร์เก็ตเด็ก
ขยันพูดคำพูดยิ่งใหญ่ประหนึ่งเพจคำคมในเฟสบุ๊คกันซะเหลือเกิ๊น 😂😂😂😂 อ่ะๆๆแต่พูดกันตรงๆหลายๆซีนมันก็ทำงานอยู่
ซีนที่ไอต้าวน้องบินออกจากเกาะแล้วรอสวิ่งตามมาเกาะไม้มองคือ 😭😭😭😭 อี่โม๊ชั่ลหน่อวด๊าเม๊จจจจ
ที่เซอร์ไพรซ์คือมันเป็นแอนิเมชันขายเด็กที่พูดเรื่องการฆ่า-ถูกฆ่าได้หน้าตาเฉยมาก 555 คือแอนิเมชันที่มีตลค.เด่นเป็นสัตว์เน้นขายเด็กส่วนใหญ่มันมักจะกระโดดข้ามพ๊อยต์นี้ไปอ่ะ แต่นะสุดท้ายก็มนุษย์นิยมพวกเรามาปรองดองกันเถอะะะะ อุตส่าห์สตาร์ทมาจริงจังดันจบแบบแฟนตาซีซะงั้น อ่ะๆๆแต่มันก็สวยงามเหมาะกับการเป็นแอนิเมชันให้เด็กดูแหละ
เอาจริงๆนะด้วยเซตติ้งนี่ไม่ชวนเชื่อเท่าไหร่เลยอ่ะโลกอนาคตที่มีโรบอตช่วยเหลือชีวิตประจำวัน แต่แกไม่มี GPS ตามติดสินค้าตัวเองถ้าโรบอตไม่เปิดสัญญาณเองก็ตามตัวไม่ได้ 🫤 ตัวเกาะเองก็เหลือจะเชื่อคือถ้าโลกมันไปถึงจุดที่มีโรบอตมาช่วยเหลือขนาดนี้แล้วมันจะเป็นไปได้หรอที่จะมีเกาะที่ร้างคนอยู่? รีสอร์ทส่วนตัวสุดหรูต้องเข้าแล้วป้ะ
ปมเรื่องแม่งเหมือนโดราเอมอนเดอะมูฟวี่ภาคที่นี่อี๋ว์ที่สุดอย่างไดโนเสาร์ตัวใหม่ของโนบิตะเลย เจอไข่->ฟักออกมาไม่สมประกอบ->เจ้าตัวน้อยเรียนรู้ที่จะบินเพื่อเข้าร่วมฝูง->ถูกบูลลี่->บินได้และกอบกู้สถานการณ์ไว้ แต่กับเรื่องนี้มันไม่ได้ชวนคิ้วกระตุกเท่าแฮะ 🤔 คิดว่าเพราะมันไม่ได้แฟนตาซีเท่า บอกชัดเจนแต่แรกเลยว่าความผิดปกติของน้องไม่ได้ส่งผลให้บินไม่ได้ เซตเรื่องไว้ว่ายังไงก็ต้องอพยพไม่งั้นตุย พูดเรื่องการเอาชีวิตรอดและความเป็นความตายหนักกว่า(ถึงจะทีเล่นทีจริงยิงมาเป็นมุกโบ๊ะบ๊ะก็เถอะ)

I accept your apology, DreamWorks.
The animation is amazing, the vocal performances are almost flawless, Kiss the sky is a treasure, the score is epic and the characters are likeable. So what exactly is the reason I only gave it a 4? The pacing. I know that adapting such a long novel into a 100 minute long movie is hard, but who said it needs to be 100 minutes. All the scenes just felt rushed and therefore the writing and directing also didn't fully fulfill their potential. It's still amazing, but fell just a little short of the hype for me.

Right from the beginning, the animation and environments caught my eye. THE BACKGROUNDS AND THE RENDERING LOOKED AMAZING. They looked painted-on, and the lighting was insane! During the movie, I couldn't help but fall in love with the beautifully portrayed family bind between a robot, a little duckling and a fox, as well as the macabre humour that would pop up and surprise me in a very pleasant way! Loved the movie, would definitely watch it again!!

Quite disappointed by this and the state of American feature animation. A tremendous achievement in the craft of animation nullified by cacophonous, never-ending jokes on top of jokes on top of jokes, stepping on every emotional beat until you realise you’ve seen this same scene before in a recent film by the same studio playing exactly as loudly and impatiently then as it is now.

The Wild Robot is one of Dreamwork's best films and is easily in my top five from the studio, I haven't decided where it'll go in my ranking but it'll be tough as I really loved this movie. From the first trailer I was excited for this and I couldn't wait to watch it, the animation especially drew me in and the story of this robot in the wild. It delivered in every way and it was amazing to watch…

Esse filme é surreal de lindo. Eu amo muito essa temática. Sou filhote das temáticas ambientais do ghibli, tipo Pompoko, Nausicã e Castelo do Céu, então gostei muito. É um filme simples mas que foi bem executado. Acredito que marcou muito algumas pessoas e por isso está sendo tão aplaudido. Comigo não foi diferente.

Monísima. Me parece súper original la idea, al final no pude evitar llorar de la emoción... 
Me encantán los animales, de verdad que siento mucha ternura hacia ellos e incluso a veces envidia hahaha
Son almas libres, no tienen reglas, viven el momento, etc. Se mueven por instinto vaya, no hay más, no piensan ni reflexionan... Ahora, nosotros como seres humanos no podemos evitar humanizarlos, ya que, en el fondo tampoco sabemos que ocurre en esas cabecitas.

I think the first act moves too quickly, especially with how fast it wants you to buy into some of the relationships evolving in the second. With that said, this film is undeniably beautiful in its own way and feels like another big shift from DreamWorks - keep them coming!

  ★★★½     Watched by Niels  29 Oct 2024   
Beautifully animated and I definitely enjoyed it, but I'm not as high on it as most people seem to be. Mostly because the story feels contrived at several points. It doesn't really flow as nicely as I hoped for. Still a good movie though.
  
  ★★★      Watched by ratedart  28 Oct 2024   
This looks absolutely stunning throughout. It lacks a little in story and the generic songs on the soundtrack pull it down here and there.

Gorgeously animated and embued with humanity, this tale of a lost robot echoes the uncertainty, chaos and purity of parenthood. The big-eyed baby goose, curious robot and sly fox make for an adorable trio to lead us through the beautiful and sometimes heart-breaking tale of raising a child and then letting go.  Matt Berry has the greatest voice on the planet.

Excellent movie, and one of the best Dreamworks animated films to date. Even with a somewhat simple story, the movie excels in every way from the beautiful animation, great characters, and emotionally impactful moments. This is a movie I feel confident about giving a 10/10 and I highly recommend it.
  
  ★★★★★      Watched by Francesco Lesti  28 Oct 2024   
According to me, this is one of the best movies of the year. The Wild Robot is capable of teach something to the people, remembering us the value of friendship and how to be a good person. The beautiful relationship between the little bird and the robot is sweet, even if it is born from a tragedy, it develops in a sweet union. The story continues in a good way and I loved every second of it.

I went into this with insanely high expectations.
Which is odd, because the trailer looked so bad that I wasn’t planning on seeing it at all.  What’s the deal with trailers that make, especially kids’ movies, look so fucking generic?  (Elemental, I’m looking at you!)
But then I kept on seeing reviews in various places (like here, for instance) and finally said, “Fine, I’ll see it!”
The movie starts, and for a while, it’s great.  Like a weird cross between… I…

I went into this looking for something change of pace to lighten my recently darkened mood and this kind of worked. 
I thought the animation style was great, the voice acting was pretty perfect- although it maybe needed a LITTLE more Matt Berry. And I still can’t picture Pedro Pascal voicing the Fox- he really tried to change his voice up for this or SOMETHING. 
While I felt like the film handled topics like found family, fitting in, friendship, and…

Estos últimos días han sido curiosos: primero "Lake Mungo" casi me mata por disentería y ahora "Robot Salvaje" casi me hace llorar, y no es para menos viendo la emoción y ganas que "Dreamworks" le ha puesto a esta peli.
Un apartado visual hermoso lleno de colores vivos que junto con la posición de los planos hace que literalmente cualquier escenario, por más simple que pueda ser, se termina volviendo en una preciosa foto que prácticamente podrías…

This movie made me BAWL in tears. 
At first I hated it, how Roz was too different from everyone even though I knew she was a robot—so literally she was built different—but then it made me realize just how much this movie is like how our world is. We are all built differently, from builds to personalities, we are all different and that’s okay. It’s okay to not belong, it’s okay not to fit in, it okay to be different, be yourself because always in the end kindness and love will always prevail. And that’s what I learned about this movie.

the ending ruined it a bit for me
what i really loved about the beginning of the movie was the fact that the predator/prey dynamics were normal and natural and death was an integral and normal part of life. but by the end i guess the animals are all buddies and the predators are just gonna starve to death now? i know this is a children's movie and the cutesy little forest animals aren't gonna be brutally devoured on screen…

“I don't have the programming to be a mother.”“You never do. You make it up.”Sentimental and funny film about the relationship between a robot mommy and a (not-ryan) gosling and creating found families, with some fun survivalist segments in the first half. There is also the main theme about free will vs destiny, such as the robot and animals having to break their "programming" to become a community. The painterly art direction is amazing, more akin to moving…

Everything about this movie is so good and pure. The animation is beautiful, the characters are pitch perfect, the score hits that sweet spot emotionally and the story is that classic, feel-good one that makes you appreciate everything that little bit more.

Dreamworks is adapting the new puss in boots look as its staple animation style. Was pretty realistic with the storytelling and did not use cliche cheesy tropes. Very colorful and enjoyable but felt very rushed. But a Pixar movie isn't complete with a generic cheerfulness that it always comes packaged with

How many times can you cry over a robot, Nick Wilde and a gosling? Yes.Oh the art of storytelling how can someone make sth ordinary and cliche at first glance SO beautiful🥹TEACH ME.“How do you know you love someone? Something?”“Well I guess you should tell them.”.“You shine like new to me.”.“Maybe they’ve heard it. Hearts have their own conversations.”.The visual is just top-tier. The animals are adorable aww and the music is great

Con THE WILD ROBOT he experimentado tres cosas muy chulas:

La espera parece haber merecido la pena, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta la belleza puramente pictórica que alcanza la película de Chris Sanders con su particular estilo de animación.

After the critical failure of the 4th Kung Fu Panda, Dreamworks finally decided to do something new and creative, adapting a book called The Wild Robot. 
The plot revolves around a robot who learns to care for a baby goose. Clearly receiving influence from the Iron Giant, the Wild Robot dives into themes of humanity in robots, showing Roz learning emotions, among other things. It also delves into parenthood, love, and forgiveness. The idea of a runt being able…

The Wild Robot, is a beautiful story of a robot, washed up after a ship wreck, who due to another accident ends up parenting a wee gosling. It’s an absolutely lovely film about parenting against the odds and fitting in. And with some of the most stunning animation I’ve ever seen. Kids and adults both laughing out loud and falling for the characters. Go see it, and you don’t need to take the kids, you’ll love it.

This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.
Just very warm and loving and heartbreaking. The structure here is most interesting in how it essentially crams three acts of a familiar mother/son coming-of-age weepie into two acts, and then uses its third act to subvert what came before - this final act feels like three separate epilogues each with their own denouement. I was often reminded of Big Jim's "Avatar: The Way of Water" (2022) and "Astro Boy" (David Bowers, 2009) because of the fps and natural scenery.…
  
  ★★★     Watched by Rupert Cole  27 Oct 2024   
Starts off small and charming, but the setup runs out of steam and the introduction of bigger world-building ideas compromise the film's cohesion. There are also whole sequences where the dialogue comprises entirely of twee adages ("sometimes hearts are having a conversation of their own" etc.), a sentimental streak that undercuts the brilliant dark humour found in the opening's deadly depiction of the wilderness. Similarly, as soon as Stephanie Hsu's Portal-inspired villain appeared, the lack of any antagonist crystallised for…

This movie is a love letter for parents everywhere especially adoptive parents. I cried at least 4 times throughout the movie. The graphics are amazing, from the quality to the tracking, the animation is so detailed, it must’ve taken so long to get right. It’s interesting from start to finish, never a dull moment in the entire film. I’ve watched it twice now and I can’t wait to watch it again. Great story, script, voice acting, animation, great everything. In my opinion, best animated movie I’ve seen this year.

Ditambah elemen persahabatan antar makhluk hidup. Isunya serius dan dewasa banget tapi ditampilkan secara sederhana dan mudah dipahami, terutama buat anak-anak. Pesannya sampai dan yang paling penting tidak menggurui.

I read the book before I watched this, there are some differences, no wonder the book's author (Peter Brown) said that it's "inspired by the book" instead of being "based on" (despite the WGA screenwriting credit system made it claim otherwise)
Otherwise it's an awesome film, second scifi film involving robots I watched on cinemas in a row

  ★★★      Rewatched by rex  25 Oct 2024   
this is a film about a woman whose taught their only objective in life is to please others, even when they don’t want it, and therefore spends her whole life trying desperately to make other people happy- other people who pretty much despise her- to the point where she, herself, begins to degrade, and, at one point, basically tears out her heart in order save someone. oh, and it’s a kid’s film.

"funny how life works"
The Wild Robot is not something that redefines the genre. It is a simple and somewhat cliche story that reflects on motherhood and the themes of growing as an outsider. What stands out is definitely its animation, from its sketch like illustrations to the vibrant colours. The simple story is also further expanded with its creative and fun details found on screen with each elements. It is a mildly heartwarming story that rushes a bit quicker than…

NomamessíestábienbonitaaaEl estilo de animación por sí solo le da una identidad muy chida; la conexión entre los protagonistas es muy bella; así como su premisa... aunque de pronto me la perdí en la segunda mitad de la peli.

They really found their guy, can’t have been a stretch, it’s very derivative of Dragon. The music, the beats, the raw ecstasy of flying. Is that a problem? Well, not really, it’s stunning and moving regardless, and especially for those kids who haven’t seen it.
It’ll be interesting to see where this first chapter fits with the planned trilogy. For me the drama created by other robots wasn’t needed, but it could be a bigger trend within the franchise.
Amazing…

SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE This movie had so many positives but the biggest thing that stands out is the animation style, it was truly breath-taking with its use of colour and light and creates a very unique look to the movie.
The story is really heartwarming and very emotional and makes the movie stand out from other modern animated movies as it explores more darker themes. But with such an emotional movie it can be slow at times which might…

The Wild Robot is a good film, the concept is very clear. However, it is set in the future where the world is pretty much in disarray and AI is the leading force of the world. The robot named 'Roz' is stranded after being shipwrecked on an island where it must adapt to the natures around it. Quite a cool storyline when you look at it.

Incredible film though (though perhaps not so much for our nephew) & extra half a star for the backdrops, I want to be in the flowery grass!

This might be one of the most phenomenal movies I have ever seen, between both live action and animated mediums. On the one hand, this shouldn’t be too surprising as we’ve been seeing a steady trend of amazing animated films as of late, between movies like Puss in Boots, Spider-Verse, and The Mitchells vs. The Machines. On the other hand, I do feel we’re in a place creatively where things can feel stagnant, repetitive, and uninspired, leading to these diamonds…

L’énorme chialade que ça aurait été si j’avais pas été entouré•e de famille (déjà se retenir de pleurer était dur). Bah j’ai juste envie de regarder et regarder et regarder ce film encore, ce doux message d’autonomisation et de savoir penser pour soi-même, en dehors de ce que l’on pense devoir être « programmé » à faire. Tout ce qui relie le technologique et le naturel j’avoue je suis bien trop fan. Rien de plus réjouissant qu’un robot (un•e robot•e ?) couvert de mousse. Vu en VF avec les neveux mais la VO a l’air dingue. Petit bonbon de douceur.

a revisit to the huge, uncompromised kind of animated storytelling that i had growing up, from the world bursting at the seams with flowery, touching details to even the folk-pop song of choice "kiss the sky" by maren morris, which plucks the same heartstrings as the 2012 song "home" by phillip phillips does without sounding as dated. lupita nyong'o continues to amaze me, and of course the animation is as beautiful as ever, but i really want to give the…

masterpiece, sensual, for children and adults. not the first and not the last cartoon with a similar plot, but definitely worth attention.

I think if this had the courage to cut all the animal dialogue, it would be an all time masterpiece.
But its still pretty dang good!

Les images et l'animation sont incroyables. Histoire simple mais réussie !

Would not be surprised if this was nominated for an academy award. The animation was colorful, vibrant, and full of expression. For an animated film, it has one of the most immersive soundtracks ever, it makes you get goosebumps as I did watching this in the theater. Will definitely be picking up a physical dvd and soundtrack copy. No-one ever has it all figured out.

Don’t hate me but this movie was super formulaic and I didn’t really feel invested in any of the characters. I loved the themes of parenting, community and found family and the film does have a lot of heart and delivers visually. But did I leave the theater a little dissatisfied? Yes, yes I did😭

me pegó justo en los mommy attachment issues (la vi con mi mamá y salimos llorando las dos). es de esas películas que no te esperas que tengan un mensaje tan profundo porque es para niños, pero esta en especial deberían verla TODOS, la familia entera incluyendo al perro. me parece que utilizar a los animales para representar sentimientos y emociones propias de los humanos fue un excelente acierto. no hay nada que le haga falta, yo sólo quiero verla una y otra vez.

I preferred the first half, but overall nice job from dreamworks, who is surprised, not me! I didn’t think I’d also be surprised at how much range Pedro Pascal has as a voice actor and I haven’t heard much buzz about it—of course everybody else understood the assignment, but idk something about Pascal’s performance went above and beyond. I’m not a furry but I work in close proximity with the community and I know they appreciate this film

Beautiful movie. Sometimes, we don’t appreciate what we have, it reminds me one of my favorite songs, “Love Yourz” by J. Cole.

Kindness is a survival skill On a scale of 1-5 stars with 1 being the least and 5 being the most, this is how i’d like to rate dreamwork’s performance
