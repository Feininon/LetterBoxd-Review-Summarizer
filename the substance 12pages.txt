Demi at 1:15 is me when I can’t get my eyeliner perfect in luteal. 
Premise started off ok… and then took a sharp turn towards absolute nonsense. I was all on board to ‘f*ck the patriarchy’, but after 2hrs 20mins, the only thing f*cked was my phone battery % as I was doom scrolling for most of this.

This is the BEST horror movie of 2024! It might be in fact be my MOVIE OF THE YEAR? This movie displays every element of horror, while also addressing real life struggles. It's beautifully grotesque in all the right ways! The film’s gory scenes might seem overwhelming, but they truly serve a purpose. If you get it, you get it. If you don’t, then you’re missing out.
I want to say so much more, but I urge people to watch it for themselves! I feel like this movie will win some awards and become a cult classic! 
An absolute masterpiece.

Not a big fan of horror. Despite that, this film has a very powerful message 🫀. Directed by a female French filmmaker (with some Stanley Kubrick vibes 🎥❤️‍🔥). Highly recommend it! 💪

Un’escalation di esagerazione che oltre a disgustarmi non ha lasciato in me significati importanti che mi hanno fatto uscire dalla sala soddisfatto.
Chiare, o forse no, le intenzioni della regista, che a mio avviso forza troppo la messa in scena di certi elementi e che sembra di voler far superficialmente apparire The substance un film più intelligente di quello che in realtà è.

🫠 as duas estrelas são unicamente pelos efeitos práticos e pela Demi Moore. De resto, o filme subestima quem assiste taxando o espectador de burro, se autoexplica e usa da montagem pra se repetir e tentar fazer a gente lembrar dos perigos da substância e o pior de tudo… o filme faz mais é idolatrar aquilo que tenta criticar.E um questionamento final: como a velha caquética que mal tava conseguindo andar, conseguiu do nada descer correndo as escadas do prédio e ainda sair correndo carregando um corpo?? Eu quero essa qualidade física na terceira idade.

Summary;
The Substance follows Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), a former fitness celebrity who suddenly finds her career fading due to her age. In an attempt to regain her youth and fame, Elisabeth tries a mysterious drug known as "The Substance", which "transforms" her into a younger, more "ideal" version of herself embodied by Sue (Margaret Qualley). Elizabeth and Sue who are now different people develop differently as Elizabeth watches Sue steal the life she always dreamed of having, jealousy and…

It is a rare enjoyment for me to sit through a movie without going “what the f*ck” because this movie really says it all. It’s truly rare to discover body horror and I’d say that The Substance truly delivers alot. Demi Moore and Margareth Qualley’s performance truly delivers so hard in the movie.

Besides the impeccable aesthetics, stellar soundtrack, and fantastic juxtapositions, there are two entry points into this, so bare with me.
One: You can't do body horror without being compared to David Cronenberg. It might be unfair, but that's the way things work. But to be honest, that title of body horror regent has been up for grabs since eXistenZ twenty five years ago. Cronenberg's kids have nibbled at the legacy,…

The movie starts off great, taking a massive dump on Hollywood and beauty standards and perfectly sets the tone. The sound design is immaculate and the visuals do not disappoint. I found the concept of the substance quite innovative and interesting, but….. halfway through the movie I started losing focus. The plot starts to stretch thin and ironically - lacks substance. Eventually it just turns into gore galore and completely shifts the camera away from the themes posed at the…

An unexpected film at last. A coarse work in the way it sends its message, but with a precise, deliberate and playful staging (Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind has exactly the same characteristics and it is no coincidence that they are both the offspring of a European director and a US production). Fargeat recreates his Revenge where, however, the character who realises the horror is also the character who experiences it (the persecutor and the persecuted coincide = solipsistic…

Fun gore. I loved it. Too bad it's strangely inconsistent at times, like: with a huge cook-out Demi does in the middle of the film, and no drumsticks come crawling out of Sue's navel for 3 months? Hardly believable.

Enfim, filme de mulheres para mulheres, crítica ao machismo, tem crítica ao etarismo da indústria, trata sobre como tudo que querem é beleza... independente de tudo que você possa ter construído em anos de carreira, após certa idade você se torna descartável

This is madness.GÉNÉREUX.DANTESQUE. RAVAGEUR.Ça cites les plus grands sans rougir (Cronenberg, Kubrick, Hitchcock, De Palma, Winding Refn, Lynch, Aronofsky...) et ça pousse les curseurs au max pour un cauchemar horrifique aussi hilarant que glacial et exténuant.

Far exceeded my expectations of how batshit crazy this was going to be! I loved a lot of things about this: the body horror elements, the colours, the extreme closeups, Demi Moore’s yellow coat, and especially how this escalates to such extreme levels of ridiculousness. I love how beauty becomes so absurd by the finale and particularly the parallel between Elisabeth frantically getting ready for her date and Monstruo Elisasue calmly getting dolled up sticking earrings into her literal head…

Of all the wild disformity shown in this, it’s still Margaret Qualley’s tiny tooth gap that manages to drives me up the wall. The movie is great otherwise.

The Substance might be the single biggest cinematic disappointment of 2024 for me. I had incredibly high hopes for it, mistake number one, and in some ways, it delivered: the acting was fantastic. Margaret Qualley, Demi Moore and Denis Quaid are class acts, nothing further to say there. The practical effects were so good! If anything, I wanted more! The Substance promises gross gore, and by god, do we get gore. My fear of needles, I'm afraid to say, was…

I am not the type that watches horror movies, ever. So this was definitely the most gruesome, nasty, disgusting, filthy piece of media my eyes have ever had to witness. But I also believe that this movie talks about a lot of very important modern problems (f.e. the obsession with ozempic, mens' fetishization of young pretty girls, plastic surgeries, drug abuse and unrealistic beauty standards that change so rapidly they're impossible to keep up with). This one was a toughie, but I can't deny that it's a piece of art.
Wish that Sue and Elisabeth had just worked it out on the remix

I’ll write more when I watch it again (soon), but for now I can say that it’s one of the best films of the year.
While this delicious, heartbreaking satire is very specifically about how women are treated in Hollywood/life, I have to raise my hand & report that this body horror fable spoke to me - very powerfully - as a disabled man who has spent his *whole life* desperately wanting to live in a different/better body.

Qué gusto da ver películas así de bien dirigidas🙏. Tiene de todo: comedia, horror y crítica. A nivel técnico destacaría la escenografía y es que se puede observar en muchos planos como buscan representar la unión de las protagonistas a través de objetos (como por ejemplo, el árbol). En lo personal, como amante del terror, me ha gustado mucho los guiños que hace a otras películas como El Resplandor, Frankenstein o Carrie.

Holy shit this is the most shocking film I've watched this year.
Visually perfect, shocking, sophisticated, and even beauuuuuuuuutiful. In this film, the visual elements are much more powerful than its story. So powerful that they overshadow the novel and traumatic storyline. 
Acting is also perfect. But still, I sometimes confuse Demi Moore with Courteney Cox.
